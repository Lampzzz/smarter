Branch Naming Convention
Use the following format for naming branches:

ST-issueNumber/description

Examples:

* ST-123/user-authentication
* ST-14/landing-page

Instructions:

* Each branch should correspond to a single issue.
* Ensure the issue number is accurate and reflects the task being addressed.

Commit Message Guidelines
When committing changes, use clear, small letter only and concise messages that follow this format:


<type>: <description>

Common Types:

* feat: A new feature (e.g., feat: add search feature)
* fix: A bug fix (e.g., fix: correct login error)
* docs: Documentation changes (e.g., docs: update README)
* style: Code style changes (e.g., style: format code with prettier)
* refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., refactor: simplify user authentication logic)
* test: Adding or updating tests (e.g., test: add unit tests for search feature)
* chore: Routine tasks and maintenance (e.g., chore: remove unnecessary files)
